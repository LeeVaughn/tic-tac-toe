# Tic Tac Toe
Play a game of tic-tac-toe with a friend or against the computer.

## Motivation
This project was created as a part of the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program.

## Features
* Two people can play against each other.
* One person can play against the computer.
* The game begins with a start screen where the players can enter their name.
* When the start button is pressed the person playing X is randomly determined and the game begins.
* Play proceeds until one player places their game piece in three squares in a row or until all of the squares are filled, at which point the game is declared a tie.
* A final screen displays the game results and along with a button to start a new game.

## Future Improvements
* Improve the play of the computer.
* Allow the players to return directly to the game board and skip the start screen when they select play again from the end screen.
* Separate some of the major functions into seperate JS files.
