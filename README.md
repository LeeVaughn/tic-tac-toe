# Tic Tac Toe (Work in Progress)
Two people can play against each other or one person can play against the computer in a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Motivation

## Features
* Two people can play against each other.
* One person can play against the computer.
* Players enter their names and then take turns placing either an X or an O on the game board.

## Possible Improvements
